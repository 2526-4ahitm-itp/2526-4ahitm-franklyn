## Project Description

Franklyn is a project that is meant to assist instructors by streaming current activities to the teachers screen during tests and exams. The program also allows the teacher to switch between different views, enabling monitoring of all students via a small dashboard that displays every active student screen, or viewing one individual screen in the detailed dashboard.
Franklyn will also allow the teacher to look at recordings of previous exams. There will also be a login system to schedule future tests.
