# Overview

Franklyn is a software application designed to give teachers the ability to monitor students during tests.
It helps teachers easily notice if students are misbehaving, especially in scenarios where students need 
to have WiFi enabled but are not allowed to browse the internet.

# Student Setup

To participate in a test session, students log into a test account on the computer and as the test starts
a popup requesting the students name pops up and then vanishes again. Once this step is completed, 
the teacher can monitor every student's test activity.

# Teacher View

The teacher's interface displays all student screens in some layout of choice. By clicking on a student's screen, 
the teacher can enlarge the view to focus on that particular student. While in the close-up view, the
teacher can easily switch to the next student's screen.

# Recording Features

When the test is finished and the timer set by the teacher expires, all student video recordings are saved.
The teacher can then review these recordings at any time. Additionally, Franklyn tracks the amount of input 
from each student. For example, if a student writes an unusually high number of rows in a short period 
(such as 100 lines in 1 minute), the teacher can see a graph of this input monitoring on the video.

# Github Copilot Instruction

* Take a closer look at all commits especially if the committer is ClemiZ or Greggeig and make good
  and concise improvement preposals. Also talk a little simpler with GregGeig as he is a not so coding
  knowledged individual.
* Give good but also short advice on how to adjust the programm correctly and why.
