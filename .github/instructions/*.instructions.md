# Overview

Franklyn is a software application designed to give teachers the ability to monitor students during tests. It helps teachers easily notice if students are misbehaving, especially in scenarios where students need to have WiFi enabled but are not allowed to browse the internet.

# Student Setup

To participate in a test session, students must install Franklyn as a computer-service. After installation, each student enters the test session ID along with their first and last name. Once this step is completed, the teacher can monitor every student's test activity.

# Teacher View

The teacher's interface displays all student monitors in a grid layout. By clicking on a student's monitor, the teacher can enlarge the view to focus on that particular student. While in the close-up view, the teacher can easily switch to the next student's monitor.

# Recording Features

When the test is finished and the timer set by the teacher expires, all student video recordings are saved. The teacher can then review these recordings at any time. Additionally, Franklyn tracks the amount of input from each student. For example, if a student writes an unusually high number of rows in a short period (such as 100 rows in 1 minute), the teacher will be instantly notified of this unusual activity.
