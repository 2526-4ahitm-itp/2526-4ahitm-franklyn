Franklyn is a software which should give teachers the opportunity to monitor students while taking a test. If the students need to have the wifi on but they are not allowed to browse the internet Franklyn makes it possible for teachers to easily notice students missbehaving. In order to accomplish that, the students will need to download Franklyn and enter the test-session-id and their first and last name. As soon as this step is completed the teacher should be able to overlook every test of every pupil. The view for the teacher which I just mentioned, will show all the Monitors of the students in a grid layout and if the teacher clicks on one field it will get big and show this students monitor. The teacher will also be able to switch to the next monitor while being on the close up view. Once the test is done and the previously set timer by the teacher runs out, all the videos of the students get saved and the teacher will be able to review them again. Franklyn will also monitor the amount of input from each student, which means that if one student writes 100 rows in 1 Minute for example, the teacher will instantly notice a peek thats beyond usual.
