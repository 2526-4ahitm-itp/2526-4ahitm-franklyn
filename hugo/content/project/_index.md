Here you can get more information about [scrum team](./scrum).

Our Scrum team consists of 4 people (Jakob - Scrum Master, Eldin - Developer,
Gregor - Marketing, Clemens - Product owner). All of these members take their roles
very seriously and make sure that everything is done correctly.

Take a look at the [minutes of meeting](./mom) or the 
[progress reports](./progress_reports) or just at the 
[general reports](./reports) in order to convince yourself of
to drive that this team truly has.
