### Github Copilot Instructions

Added clarifications on how to write those and review together what is
best for franklyn.

### Improved Readme

Reviewed the Readme improvments, made a couple changes and got merged into
main.

### Wayland and X-Org

Postponed wayland support for now as this requires more research and
more implementation for different systems.
