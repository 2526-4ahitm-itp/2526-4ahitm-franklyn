⚠️ NOTE: This Landing Page is subject to 
further change during development of the project

## Where to Start?

Some interesting docs are:

* [Explanation](./explanation)

* [How-To Guides](./how-to-guides)

* [Reference](./reference)

## Purpose of the Docs

The goal of our documentation is to provide all the info about Franklyn you could need.
If you are a regular Franklyn user, you will not need most of our documentation,
and I recommend you check out our [guide](../guide) which describes how to use Franklyn,
or our [landing page](..) which contains useful info for the installation process


## Navigation

To navigate through our documentation you could check out the
additional documentation tab on our [landing page](..), or you
can use the sidebar menu to switch between the subcategories of the docs.
