⚠️ NOTE: This Landing Page is subject to 
further change during development of the project

## Where to Start?

Some interesting docs are:

[The Main Page](..)

[The Developer Guide](./project_guide) (for developers)

[The Architecture Page](./architecture) (for nerds)


## Documentation Structure?

The documentation contains multiple subfolders:

- [Architecture](./architecture) shows our project architecture,
  for example the class diagram and the websocket connections
- [Looks](./looks) showcases our design specifications

## Purpose of the Docs

The goal of our documentation is to provide all the info about Franklyn you could need.
If you are a regular Franklyn user, you will not need most of our documentation,
and I recommend you check out our [guide](../guide) which describes how to use Franklyn,
or our [landing page](..) which contains useful info for the installation process


## Navigation

To navigate through our documentation you could check out the
additional documentation tab on our [landing page](..), or you
can use the sidebar menu to switch between the subcategories of the docs.
